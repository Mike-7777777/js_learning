# js_learning

an learning notebook of javascript.

This repository is for programmer who learned some languages like Java or C.
So it will not include all basic stuffs like comment use of if statement, for loop, switch statements and so on, or something doesn't really matters for coding and using js. Also, this notebook will ignore some content that conforms to human intuition, such as 0 should correspond to false instead of true.

Hope this repository could help you learn js more efficiently by reading the code.
